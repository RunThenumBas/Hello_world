# Hello_world
The beginning of another long story

Hello all RunThenumBas here,

Currently invested in the trade welding and its great and all but I feel as though there are bigger and better opertunities out there then for me. I am very intriuded by the exploration of space, futher development in technoligy and upper limits to the human brain and what we can acheive as a collective. Learning to code I feel will give me a foot in the door towards pursuing one of those inerests if not all of them!
